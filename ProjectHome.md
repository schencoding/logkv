Event log processing and analysis play a key role in applications ranging from security management, IT trouble shooting, to user behavior analysis. Recent years have seen a rapid growth in system
scales and the corresponding rapid increase in the amount of log event data.  At the same time, as logs are found to be a valuable information source, log analysis tasks have become more sophisticated
demanding both interactive exploratory query processing and batch computation. Desirable query types include selection with time ranges and value filtering criteria, join within time windows, join between
log data and reference tables, and various aggregation types.  In such a situation, parallel solutions are necessary, but existing parallel and distributed solutions either support limited query types or
perform only batch computations on logs.  With a system called LogKV, this paper reports a first study of using Key-Value stores to support log processing and analysis, exploiting the scalability, reliability,
and efficiency commonly found in Key-Value store systems.  LogKV contains a number of unique techniques that are needed to handle log data in terms of event ingestion, load balancing, storage optimization, and query processing.  Preliminary experimental results
show that LogKV is a promising solution.
